KILA is an autonomous institution functioning for the Local governments in Kerala since 1990. KILA has been engaged in a myriad of capacity-building interventions on local governance and decentralization; including training, action research, publications, seminars and workshops, consultancy, documentation, handholding, and information services. Woodwell Climate Research Center (Woodwell). Woodwell Climate Research Centerfounded in 1985 as the Woods Hole Research Centeris a scientific research organization that conducts science for solutions at the nexus of climate, people, and nature. Woodwell partners with leaders and communities from the Arctic to the Amazon for just, meaningful impact to address the climate crisis. GeoHazards International (GHI). GHI has been working with a major thrust in the areas of Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and Climate Change Adaptation (CCA) across India and South Asia (Nepal, Bhutan, and Myanmar). GeoHazards Society (GHS). Since 2008, GHS is working towards making the countrys most vulnerable communities safer from various hazards including climatic, geological, and human induced hazards. GHS along with its partners seek to associate with Government agencies in Kerala with the common goal to equip communities to combat the effects of climate change and instill preparedness and mitigation practices.

Her current work examines climate impacts on a range of scalesfrom the intersection of climate change and national and regional security to working with under-resourced communities to build their climate resilience. Dr. Naegele completed a B.S. in Environmental Science from The Ohio State University. After graduating, she served in the Peace Corps and worked on community-based adaptation to climate change in rural Morocco, where communities were facing the challenges of extended drought and extreme rainfall. She returned from the Peace Corps with the goal of bridging the science and the societal impacts of climate change, completing her M.S. and Ph.D. in Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University, where she also earned a graduate certificate in International Development. Darcy Glenn Darcy Glenn utilizes climate modeling to provide information to decision-makers about the near-term impacts of climate change as part of Woodwell Climate Research Centers Risk program. She works with both municipalities and business investors who aim to adapt to the changing climate. Previously, Darcy worked for two local governments: Park City, Utah and Summit County, Utah. There she had the privilege to work on the Most Ambitious Climate Goals in North America allowing her to work on carbon accounting, wildfire adaptation, regenerative agriculture, and electrification policy. She received her MSc in Climate Change from University College London. Speakers Carl Churchill Carl Churchill is a graphics reporter with The Wall Street Journal. He works primarily on issues relating to climate, ecology, and current events. He joined the Journal after working as a Cartographer for the Woodwell Climate Research Center, a climate science organization based in Massachusetts. While there, he received recognition for his graphics work on Amazon deforestation and Arctic climate change. He has a masters in GIS from Arizona State University. Abash Paudel Abash Paudel has received both his MSc General Forestry and BS Forest Ecology from Tribhuvan Universitys Institute of Forestry. He has worked on a variety of projects including the Impact of Climate Variability on Snow Cover in Annaurna Conservation Area. Mr. Paudel is well versed in a variety of geospatial tools including Google Earth Engine and GIS.
