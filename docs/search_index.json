Please do this as soon as possible! Sometimes it takes longer than expected to go through. It is free and requires a Google account. Instructions can be found in the Google Earth Engine Section of this website. Planned Modules A .pdf of planned modules can be found here. *Participants will be polled on preferences for Modules 1a-d on Day 2. Day 1 Before the session, make sure you have access to Google Earth Engine and download the practice data sets for Technical Session Day 1. Module 1 Ensure All Students Able to Log On (Darcy Glenn) Module 2 Introduction to Google Earth Engine (Darcy Glenn) Upload files from computer &amp; catalogue Basic commands Display data Calculate the number of days above 25°C (Demonstration) Students can choose from 25°C, 30°C, 35°C, 40°C, or 45°C Module 3 Recap and Q&amp;A (Bishal Bharadwaj, Prof. Rajesh K Rai, Darcy Glenn) Day 2 Before the session, download the practice data sets for Technical Session Day 2. Participants will be polled on preferences for Modules 1a-d. The Module selected will be determined by Day 1 of the Technical Sessions. This will give participants time to download data. Module 1a* Using Daily Data: Projecting Extreme Heat Days (Darcy Glenn) Review projection methodology concept Wet-bulb temperature: Heat &amp; humidity measurements are related to human health. Use Google Earth Engine to project days above 28°C wet-bulb Export data Module 1b* Using Daily Data: Projecting Extreme Rainfall (Darcy Glenn) Review projection methodology concept Precipitation: Extreme precipitation can result in flooding and affects infrastructure, agriculture, and water supply. Use Google Earth Engine to project changes in the amount of rain that falls in the top 5% of rainy/snowy days Export data Module 1c* Using Daily Data: Projecting Night Temperatures (Darcy Glenn) Review projection methodology concept Minimum temperature: When the nighttime temperature is too high, our bodies cannot recover during a heatwave. Use Google Earth Engine to project changes to heat waves with high nighttime temperatures Export data Module 1d* Using Daily Data: Who is Affected by High Temperatures? (Darcy Glenn) Review projection methodology concept Maximum temperature: Thresholds as seen in the Day 1, but now with daily data Import information from Google Earth Engines Catalogue to see who will be affected Export data Module 2 Recap and Q&amp;A (Bishal Bharadwaj, Prof. Rajesh K Rai, Darcy Glenn) Day 3 Module 1 Participant-led map making Module 2 How Risk Mapping Skills Can Help Society (Bishal Bharadwaj, Prof. Rajesh K Rai, Darcy Glenn) Module 3 Recap and Q&amp;A (Bishal Bharadwaj, Prof. Rajesh K Rai, Darcy Glenn) Homework If maps are not complete for the presentation, you may need to meet outside of the workshop. Day 4 Module 1 Group Presentations Module 2 Recap and Q&amp;A (Bishal Bharadwaj, Prof. Rajesh K Rai, Darcy Glenn) Powerpoints Powerpoints are coming soon. Data sets Data sets and scripts can be found here. The DataFiles_Technical_Session_Day_1.zip includes the code scripts and data sets needed for Day 1. Please download before Day 1. Videos Technical Session Day 1 - Cohort A - Sunday, September 11, 2022 Technical Session Day 1 - Cohort B - Friday, September 16, 2022 Bishal Bharadwaj and Suman Shree Neupane facilitated the session for Cohort A. Bishal Bharadwaj and Dr. David Byrne facilitated the session for Cohort B. Darcy Glenn walked participants through: Where data came from How to download data from Github The parts of the Google Earth Engine dashboard Creating a repository Uploading files Creating file folders Importing data from file into scripts Saving scripts Combining 3 models into an ensemble Finding the difference between the ensembles future data and past data Changing a maps appearance Using the Explorer tool to find values at a specific location. Technical Session Day 1 - Cohort A - Monday, September 12, 2022 Technical Session Day 1 - Cohort B - Saturday, September 17, 2022 Technical Session Day 2 - Cohort A - Monday 12, 2022 Technical Session Day 2 - Cohort B - Saturday 17, 2022 Bishal Bharadwaj and Suman Shree Neupane facilitated the session. Darcy Glenn walked participants through: Applying a model ensembles difference to reanalysis data to find future values Formatting maps Dr. David Byrne presented: The Google Earth Engine catalog How to import different types of population data from the catalog For Cohort B, Dr. David Byrne hosted a breakout room that walked participants who missed Day 1 through the introduction to Google Earth Engine and their first code. Technical Session Day 3 - Cohort A - Sunday, September 18, 2022 Technical Session Day 3 - Cohort B - Friday, September 23, 2022 Technical Session Day 4 - Cohort A - Monday, September 19, 2022 Independant Maps Participants created their own maps with the climate data. Map within Google Earth Engine by Keshav Dubedi (top left), Lalita Joshi (top right), Damber Bista (bottom left), and Abash Paudel (bottom right). Geotiffs that have been exported and can now be imported into any mapping software as demonstrated by Bipin Bhattarai. Arbin Poudel applied his previous experience with GIS to clip his geotiff to Nepal. Suraj Bist applied his previous experience with GIS to enhance his final map.

"],["speaker-bios.html", "4 Speaker Bios Hosts Speakers", " 4 Speaker Bios Hosts Dr. Alex Naegele With an interdisciplinary background in climate science, environmental science, and international development, Dr. Alexandra Naegele studies the impact of climate change on society. Her current work examines climate impacts on a range of scalesfrom the intersection of climate change and national and regional security to working with under-resourced communities to build their climate resilience. Dr. Naegele completed a B.S. in Environmental Science from The Ohio State University. After graduating, she served in the Peace Corps and worked on community-based adaptation to climate change in rural Morocco, where communities were facing the challenges of extended drought and extreme rainfall. She returned from the Peace Corps with the goal of bridging the science and the societal impacts of climate change, completing her M.S. and Ph.D. in Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University, where she also earned a graduate certificate in International Development. Darcy Glenn Darcy Glenn utilizes climate modeling to provide information to decision-makers about the near-term impacts of climate change as part of Woodwell Climate Research Centers Risk program. She works with both municipalities and business investors who aim to adapt to the changing climate. Previously, Darcy worked for two local governments: Park City, Utah and Summit County, Utah. There she had the privilege to work on the Most Ambitious Climate Goals in North America allowing her to work on carbon accounting, wildfire adaptation, regenerative agriculture, and electrification policy. She received her MSc in Climate Change from University College London. Speakers Carl Churchill Carl Churchill is a graphics reporter with The Wall Street Journal. He works primarily on issues relating to climate, ecology, and current events. He joined the Journal after working as a Cartographer for the Woodwell Climate Research Center, a climate science organization based in Massachusetts. While there, he received recognition for his graphics work on Amazon deforestation and Arctic climate change. He has a masters in GIS from Arizona State University. Abash Paudel Abash Paudel has received both his MSc General Forestry and BS Forest Ecology and Biology from Tribhuvan Universitys Institute of Forestry. He has worked on a variety of projects including the Impact of Climate Variability on Snow Cover in Annaurna Conservation Area. Mr. Paudel is well versed in a variety of geospatial tools including Google Earth Engine and GIS.
